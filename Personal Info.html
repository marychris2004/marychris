<h1> My Autobiography </h1>
<p>Hi my name is Mary Chris D. Quirante I am 19 years of age, I was born in December 4, 2004. I live in Fatima, Liloy Zamboanga del Norte. I am a simple teenager. I am skinnny, tall, brown-skinned and have a short hair. I am a little bit shy.</p> 
<p>My Father's name is Cres Cuaton Quirante he worked at Zaneco, My Mother's name is Maria Luz Doong Quirante she is a housewife. I have 2 siblings my eldest sister named Maureen and I am a middle child my youngest brother named Noel.</p>
<p>They are my most caring and loving parents that always support our needs. I cannot imagine my life without them because without my mother and father I am nothing. They are my strength to this tiring world.</p>
<p>I'm so lucky to have a family like them eventhough we are not perfect atleast we are happy and contented.</p>
<p>My hobbies are reading wattpads, washing dishes, doing laundry and watching movies. I can dance, but I'm not very good at singing. as well as to draw.</p>
<p>I like collecting moments and memories, fan of capturing every moment, I love to hangout with my family.making memories together and despite all problems that we face.</p>
<p>When I was in Elementary I studied at Liloy Central School from Grade 1-6, while in Senior/HighSchool I studied at Liloy National High School from Grade 7-12, They are both located at Liloy, Zamboanga del Norte.</p>
<p>I want to pursue my dreams no matter what happened because I know to myself that I can do it. And I know it's difficult but if you want it just believe in yourself and make that difficult motivate and inspired you to achieve and finish your study.</p>
